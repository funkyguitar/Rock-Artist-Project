This analysis examines the rock artists selected by students in a History of Rock Music course to write for an end of term rock artist biography assignment at a community college located in the Pacific Northwest. 500 students wrote biographies between 2018 - 2023, 273 were female, 198 male, and 29 students of unknown gender. The most popular artists selected were identified, with Elvis Presley being at the top of the list, approximately one out of every ten female students (36 students choose to write about Elvis, 29 female, 7 male). Elvis was chosen more than twice as often as the second place artist, Freddie Mercury, at 17. Students were over three times as likely to write about an individual than a band (392 to 108), even if the individual came to fame in a band (in other words, students overwhelmingly chose Jim Morrison instead of The Doors, Kurt Cobain instead of Nirvana, etc.). Similarly, students were over three times as likely to write about a North American artist than a British artist (373 to 114). This held true across both genders.
In the analysis of rock genres, hard rock emerged as the predominant subgenre among students. A notable observation is the consistency in genre preferences between male and female students, with nine out of the top 10 genres being the same for both groups. For genre classification, I utilized the Spotify API, which provided a comprehensive genre dataset. However, it's worth noting that we excluded certain genres from our analysis. Genres like mellow gold, album rock, classic rock, rock, and pop were omitted. These were either too obscure or too general to yield meaningful insights for this study's objectives.
